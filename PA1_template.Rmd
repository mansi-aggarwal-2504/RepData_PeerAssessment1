## Loading and preprocessing the data
1. First we will unzip the file, load the data and take a quick look at the data.

```{r}
unzip("./activity.zip")
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv")
summary(activityData)
```


```{r}
names(activityData)
```


```{r}
head(activityData)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
1. We will start by calculating the total number of steps taken per day.

```{r}
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activityData, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

2. Now we will plot a histogram of total steps per day.

```{r}
hist(stepsPerDay$steps)
```

3. Calculating the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.
```{r}
meanStepsPerDay <- mean(stepsPerDay$steps)
meanStepsPerDay
```

```{r}
medianStepsPerDay <- median(stepsPerDay$steps)
medianStepsPerDay
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Making a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

```{r}
stepsPerInterval<-aggregate(steps~interval, data=activityData, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(steps~interval, data=stepsPerInterval, type="l")
```

2. he 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, containing the maximum number of steps:

```{r}
intervalWithMaxNbSteps <- stepsPerInterval[which.max(stepsPerInterval$steps),]$interval
intervalWithMaxNbSteps
```

## Imputing missing values

1. Calculating the total number of missing values in the dataset:

```{r}
totalValuesMissings <- sum(is.na(activityData$steps))
totalValuesMissings
```

2. Let’s use a simple strategy or filling in all of the missing values in the dataset: we’ll fill in all the missing values in the dataset with the mean per interval. Here’s the function that will return, for a particular interval, the mean value.

```{r}
getMeanStepsPerInterval<-function(interval){
    stepsPerInterval[stepsPerInterval$interval==interval,]$steps
}
```

3. Creating a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in:

```{r}
activityDataNoNA<-activityData
for(i in 1:nrow(activityDataNoNA)){
    if(is.na(activityDataNoNA[i,]$steps)){
        activityDataNoNA[i,]$steps <- getMeanStepsPerInterval(activityDataNoNA[i,]$interval)
    }
}
```

4. A histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

```{r}
totalStepsPerDayNoNA <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activityDataNoNA, sum)
hist(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)
```

```{r}
meanStepsPerDayNoNA <- mean(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)
medianStepsPerDayNoNA <- median(totalStepsPerDayNoNA$steps)
```

The mean didn’t change after the replacements of NAs, the median changed about 0.1% of the original value.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Creating a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
activityDataNoNA$date <- as.Date(strptime(activityDataNoNA$date, format="%Y-%m-%d"))
activityDataNoNA$day <- weekdays(activityDataNoNA$date)
for (i in 1:nrow(activityDataNoNA)) {
    if (activityDataNoNA[i,]$day %in% c("Saturday","Sunday")) {
        activityDataNoNA[i,]$day<-"weekend"
    }
    else{
        activityDataNoNA[i,]$day<-"weekday"
    }
}
stepsByDay <- aggregate(activityDataNoNA$steps ~ activityDataNoNA$interval + activityDataNoNA$day, activityDataNoNA, mean)
```

2. Making a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 

```{r}
names(stepsByDay) <- c("interval", "day", "steps")
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | day, stepsByDay, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), 
    xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
```
